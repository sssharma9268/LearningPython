# Business challenge/requirement
# You are a data analyst with University of Cal USA (Not a machine learning expert yet as you still have not completed ML with
# Python Course :-)).The University has data of Math, Physics and Data Structure  score of sophomore students. This data is stored in
# different files. The University has hired a data science company to do analysis of scores and find if there is any correlation of score
# with age, ethnicity etc. Before the data is given to the company you have to do data wrangling. Key issues Ensure students identify is
# not revealed   to the agency and only relevant data is shared Considerations NONE
# Data volume-In thousands, but only around 1800 records are shared in files MathScoreTerm1.csv
# DSScoreTerm1.csv, PhysicsScoreTerm1.csv
# Additional information-NA
# Business benefits-
# University can get more students enrollment by improving its international ranking through personalized course/curriculum for students
# Approach to Solve
# You have to use fundamentals of Numpy and Pandas covered in module 4.
# 1. Read the three csv files which contains the score of same students in term1 for each Subject
# 2. Remove the name and ethnicity column (to ensure confidentiality)
# 3. Fill missing score data with zero
# 4. Merge the three files
# 5. Change Sex(M/F) Columnto 1/2 for further analysis
# 6. Store the data in new file â€“ScoreFinal.csv
# Enhancements for code
# You can try these enhancements in code
# 1. Convert ethnicity to numerical value
# 2. Fill the missing score for a student to the average of the class
